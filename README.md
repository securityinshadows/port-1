Website accessible at: https://securityinshadows.github.io/port-1/


This is a very simple static website, I figured that my first portfolio project (port-1) would need to be simple and digestible.

The site will be used to store my finished projects/portfolio, kind of a milestone tracker :D

	In this static site you can:
		1 - Switch between light and dark mode.
		2 - Submit a form to contact me.
		3 - Navigate to different sections of the page.
		4 - Find my links.
